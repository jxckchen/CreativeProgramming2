## Emotion Enhancing Glitch Mask

## Description
This project utilizes P5js webcam tracking and Google's TensorFlow API to track the user's face. It enlarges certain features of their face to simulate a positive emotion, to combat resting b***h faces. There is also a random glitch effect to embrace the aesthetic.
